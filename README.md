This is my final year Project.

    ├── keypoints_loc.txt
    ├── keypoints_vis.txt
    ├── pattern_ann.txt
    └── shape_anno_all.txt

Download datasets form "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/125F48fsMBz2EF0Cpqk6aaHet5VH399Ok" you need to fill form "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIoGaFfCQILrtIZPykkr8q_h9qQ5BoTYbjvf95aXbid0v2Bw/viewform?pli=1" to unzip those files.
